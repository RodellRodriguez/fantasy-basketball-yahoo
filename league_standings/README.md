# Yahoo Fantasy Basketball League Standings

## Description

To my knowledge, Yahoo offers a league standings functionality for each stat but it's only numbers based and the functionality is not on a week to week basis but for the entire season. As the weeks go on, that functionality isn't helpful because teams constantly change their roster via trades or waivers so the data will be skewed if you look at the stats overall. 

For example say Team A has a team focused on Guards so most likely that team will do terrible in the REB category. That team manager may start to make great strides in acquiring more Centers and/or Forwards to augment his REB numbers as the works go on. Another competing teaming, Team B, might not be able to notice the changes in  Team A quickly if Team B relied on the overall league standings functionality since the data would still be heavily influenced by Team A's previous Guard heavy roster. 

So achieving higher granularity with a week to week basis would tell a more accurate story. Depending on how ambitious I want to take this, I could import the data visualizations into a website to allow easy viewership. For now I want a base ETL model to work with so I can start producing graphs quickly. This will be a great learning experience to learn about data pipelining and data management
