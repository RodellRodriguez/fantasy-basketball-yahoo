## fantasy-basketball-yahoo

**Description**

This Python Selenium script logs into the Yahoo fantasy basketball account and so far it will tell you a few players: name, team, assigned fantasy position, and if they're playing today. I will edit the script such that it will display all players on your team. So far I only do 2 players.
