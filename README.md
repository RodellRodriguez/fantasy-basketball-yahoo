# Yahoo Fantasy Basketball 

## Description

I am an avid basketball fan but never really got into the fantasy sports culture. It is my first time playing Fantasy Basketball and my friends decided to use Yahoo's Fantasy Basketball website to play.

This repo is a collection of 2 seperate Python programs that accomplish the following:

1. Automates starting  your roster for any number of games in the future

2. Create a data pipeline of Yahoo's API and use that pipelined data to produce data visualizations and tables of league standings for each stat category (FG%, PTS, FT%, STL, BLK, TO, AST, 3PTM, REB) on a week to week basis. This is to inform all players of the league of which team is stronger/weaker in certain categories. This can assist in making better decisions in key trades and waivers.
