# Yahoo Fantasy Basketball 

## Description

I am an avid basketball fan but never really got into the fantasy sports culture. It is my first time playing Fantasy Basketball and my friends decided to use Yahoo's Fantasy Basketball website to play.

This repo accomplishes is a collection of 2 seperate Python programs that doe the following:

1. Auotmates starting  your roster for any number of games in the future

2. ETL (extract, load, transform) data pipeline of Yahoo's API to produce data visualizations of league standings for each stat category (FG%, PTS, FT%, STL, BLK, TO, AST, 3PTM, REB) on a week to week basis.
